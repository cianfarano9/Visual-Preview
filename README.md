# Visual-Preview
Preview of the start of my visual assignment. 
This is the initial version of my project. All of the images included are from my own photography. I photographed a friend wearing a piece of fast-fashion purchased clothing and edited the image in a couple different ways. Despite her happy expression and the brightly filtered background (warm colors, bright, and a feeling of sun) the clothing itself competes with that as it is varying shades of deep blues. I hoped that this would create some contrast. I also split up the images of her into smaller segmented images and pieces them back together in hopes to create a ‘sewn together’ pattern that would replicate the feel of textiles being haphazardly sewn together. Along with this, I added black and red splotches throughout the images as I layered them atop one another. I placed them specifically on the clothing she is wearing to show that while the clothes themselves are beautiful or attractive, they do come at a cost that could result in the loss of lives. I hoped that this subtle red would replicate blood in a way that was not too graphic, but also not subtle enough so that a viewer could piece this together. While I am still working on getting this to a place I would like it to be and am getting more used to Gimp as a software, I am happy with the path I am on so far. I am hoping to further hone in the textile imagery by perhaps adding some threads too stitch the images together more literally.
